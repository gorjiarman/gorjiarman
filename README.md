### Hi there, I'm <a href="https://gorjiarman" target="_blank">Arman Gorji</a> ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about leveraging AI and computational methods to address challenges in medical science and public health. With a background in medicine and expertise in deep learning and machine learning, my goal is to contribute to healthcare solutions on a larger scale than I could as a physician alone.
I enjoy transforming ideas into impactful solutions, whether through data-driven insights or algorithm development. My work spans medical imaging, predictive modeling, and explainable AI, with a focus on improving diagnostics and treatment strategies. I am always eager to collaborate and learn, driven by the belief that interdisciplinary research is key to advancing healthcare.
